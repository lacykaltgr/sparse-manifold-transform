    This matrix update the basis function based on the Hessian matrix of the activation.
    It's very similar to Newton method. But since the Hessian matrix of the activation function is often ill-conditioned, we takes the pseudo inverse.

    Note: currently, we can just use the inverse of the activation energy.
    A better idea for this method should be caculating the local Lipschitz constant for each of the basis.
    The stepSize should be smaller than 1.0 * min(activation) to be stable.
